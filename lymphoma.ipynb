Therefore, finding results like those found by Dunleavy et al. is very unlikely. Furthermore, in our second simulation we found that only about 16% of the trials will give a publication. Considering the outcomes of their study, the evidence found with the simulations and the information provided by the NHS (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/treatment/) and the Lymphoma Action organisation (https://lymphoma-action.org.uk/types-lymphoma-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/burkitt-lymphoma) -that one of the most common treatments is the administration of rituximab-, their treatment must be more effective than other standard options available.
