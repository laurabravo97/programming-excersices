# Structured programming exercise

The exercise consists of five notebooks.

Each notebook sits in its own directory, with its own tests and data files.

Within each notebook, each question counts for the same number of points.

The number of points for each notebook, from the total of 80, are:

* `lymphoma`: 10
* `pandering`: 15
* `religion`: 10
* `titanic`: 20
* `spouses`: 25

For example, the `lymphoma` notebook has 5 questions.  Each counts for 10
/ 5 = 2 marks out of the 80 marks available from this exercise.

The `spouses` notebook allows you a lot more flexibility than the others, and
therefore counts for 25 marks out of the 80 available.  See that notebook for
the marking scheme.

We suggest you fill in the notebooks in the order given above.  You should
certainly try `titanic` before you get on to `spouses`.

Submit the exercise by:

*   Making a single zip file that contains *all five directories*, and
    therefore all five notebooks.
*   Specifically, your zip file should contain:

    * `lymphoma.ipynb` in a directory called `lymphoma`;
    * `pandering.ipynb` in a directory called `pandering`;
    * `religion.ipynb` in a directory called `religion`;
    * `titanic.ipynb` in a directory called `titanic`;
    * `spouses.ipynb` in a directory called `spouses`.

    You may want to use other data files for the `spouses` part of the exercise.
    If so, please make sure that these data files are in the `spouses` directory in
    your zip file, along with the `spouses.ipynb` notebook.

*   Submit this zip file, containing all five directories and notebooks, to
    Canvas.
