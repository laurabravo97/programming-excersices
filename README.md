# Structured programming exercise

The exercise consists of five notebooks.

Each notebook sits in its own directory, with its own tests and data files.

Within each notebook, each question counts for the same number of points.

The number of points for each notebook, from the total of 80, are:

* `lymphoma`: 10
* `pandering`: 15
* `religion`: 10
* `titanic`: 20
* `spouses`: 25

The `spouses` notebook allows you a lot more flexibility than the others, and
therefore counts for 25 marks out of the 80 available.  

We suggest you fill in the notebooks in the order given above.  You should
certainly try `titanic` before you get on to `spouses`.
